# PA4 Skeleton Code
We expect a fully functioninig command line REPL application for an inventory querying system. Feel free to modify the skeleton code as you see fit.

### How to run the current skeleton code
`make` will compile and execute the skeleton code

The application ships with the zip file containing the csv to minimize the size of the repo.
Assuming your system can run the `unzip` command, it will be unzipped into lib/ on the first run.

Only fields up to SKU will be populated, as anything other than Uniq ID, Product Name, and Categories are useless to this project.
